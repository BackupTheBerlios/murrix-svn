About
=====
MURRiX is a Content Management System created from scratch.
The project was created in the end of the summer 2005 by Mattias Runge which also maintains it.
It is written in PHP and uses MySQL for datastorage.
It also relies on the library xAjax, http://xajax.sourceforge.net.
It also uses Exifer for exif header extraction, http://www.offsky.com/software/exif/index.php.
Also distributed with MURRiX is some icons from the CrystalSVG iconset which is a part of KDE.
JUpload, http://www.jupload.biz, is also distributed with MURRiX to offer a easy way of uploading files.

The basis for MURRiX is its nodes. All data stored in objects which are connected to nodes.
It is possible to have diffrent versions av objects connected to the same node. This makes it possible to track changes and have content i diffrent languages.
These objects is instances of classes that can be defined by a siteadmin.
This approach makes it possible to create any type of object to suite any need.

MURRiX also supports different templates for the possibility of creating a unique GUI for a page.
All templates uses php, this makes it easy to learn.

This is a work in progress.
